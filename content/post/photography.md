I love photography. And I am lucky enough to live in a country and city that makes it easy.

Almost feels like cheating at times.

This winter I went out looking at a meteor shower. I did not get any good photos of the shower itself, but I was able to capture the northern lights. Worth being tired the next day at work!

Bergen is a very photogenic place, and this awesome view is about a 2 hour walk from downtown.
